# Campus-Placement-Analysis-using-Python
I used Python to clean campus placement data and performed EDA to identify how skills, academics, and internships influence placement and salary.

This project analyzes campus placement data using Python to understand how academics, skills, and internships affect student placement and salary, using data cleaning and visualization techniques.
